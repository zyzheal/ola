# Subagents

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks within Qwen Code. They allow you to delegate focused work to AI agents that are configured with task-specific prompts, tools, and behaviors.

## What are Subagents?

Subagents are independent AI assistants that:

- **Specialize in specific tasks** - Each Subagent is configured with a focused system prompt for particular types of work
- **Have separate context** - They maintain their own conversation history, separate from your main chat
- **Use controlled tools** - You can configure which tools each Subagent has access to
- **Work autonomously** - Once given a task, they work independently until completion or failure
- **Provide detailed feedback** - You can see their progress, tool usage, and execution statistics in real-time

## Key Benefits

- **Task Specialization**: Create agents optimized for specific workflows (testing, documentation, refactoring, etc.)
- **Context Isolation**: Keep specialized work separate from your main conversation
- **Reusability**: Save and reuse agent configurations across projects and sessions
- **Controlled Access**: Limit which tools each agent can use for security and focus
- **Progress Visibility**: Monitor agent execution with real-time progress updates

## How Subagents Work

1. **Configuration**: You create Subagents configurations that define their behavior, tools, and system prompts
2. **Delegation**: The main AI can automatically delegate tasks to appropriate Subagents
3. **Execution**: Subagents work independently, using their configured tools to complete tasks
4. **Results**: They return results and execution summaries back to the main conversation

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Create your first Subagent**:

   `/agents create`

   Follow the guided wizard to create a specialized agent.

2. **Manage existing agents**:

   `/agents manage`

   View and manage your configured Subagents.

3. **Use Subagents automatically**: Simply ask the main AI to perform tasks that match your Subagents' specializations. The AI will automatically delegate appropriate work.

### Example Usage

```
User: "Please write comprehensive tests for the authentication module"
AI: I'll delegate this to your testing specialist Subagents.
[Delegates to "testing-expert" Subagents]
[Shows real-time progress of test creation]
[Returns with completed test files and execution summary]`
```

## Management

### CLI Commands

Subagents are managed through the `/agents` slash command and its subcommands:

**Usage:**：`/agents create`。Creates a new Subagent through a guided step wizard.

**Usage:**：`/agents manage`。Opens an interactive management dialog for viewing and managing existing Subagents.

### Storage Locations

Subagents are stored as Markdown files in multiple locations:

- **Project-level**: `.qwen/agents/` (highest precedence)
- **User-level**: `~/.qwen/agents/` (fallback)
- **Extension-level**: Provided by installed extensions

This allows you to have project-specific agents, personal agents that work across all projects, and extension-provided agents that add specialized capabilities.

### Extension Subagents

Extensions can provide custom subagents that become available when the extension is enabled. These agents are stored in the extension's `agents/` directory and follow the same format as personal and project agents.

Extension subagents:

- Are automatically discovered when the extension is enabled
- Appear in the `/agents manage` dialog under "Extension Agents" section
- Cannot be edited directly (edit the extension source instead)
- Follow the same configuration format as user-defined agents

To see which extensions provide subagents, check the extension's `qwen-extension.json` file for an `agents` field.

### File Format

Subagents are configured using Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. This format is human-readable and easy to edit with any text editor.

#### Basic Structure

```
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of when and how to use this agent
tools:
	- tool1
	- tool2
	- tool3 # Optional
---

System prompt content goes here.
Multiple paragraphs are supported.
You can use ${variable} templating for dynamic content.
```

#### Example Usage

```
---
name: project-documenter
description: Creates project documentation and README files
---

You are a documentation specialist for the ${project_name} project.

Your task: ${task_description}

Working directory: ${current_directory}
Generated on: ${timestamp}

Focus on creating clear, comprehensive documentation that helps both
new contributors and end users understand the project.
```

## Using Subagents Effectively

### Automatic Delegation

Qwen Code proactively delegates tasks based on:

- The task description in your request
- The description field in Subagents configurations
- Current context and available tools

To encourage more proactive Subagents use, include phrases like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" in your description field.

### Explicit Invocation

Request a specific Subagent by mentioning it in your command:

```
Let the testing-expert Subagents create unit tests for the payment module
Have the documentation-writer Subagents update the API reference
Get the react-specialist Subagents to optimize this component's performance
```

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle

Each Subagent should have a clear, focused purpose.

**✅ Good:**

```
---
name: testing-expert
description: Writes comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
---
```

**❌ Avoid:**

```
---
name: general-helper
description: Helps with testing, documentation, code review, and deployment
---
```

**Why:** Focused agents produce better results and are easier to maintain.

#### Clear Specialization

Define specific expertise areas rather than broad capabilities.

**✅ Good:**

```
---
name: react-performance-optimizer
description: Optimizes React applications for performance using profiling and best practices
---
```

**❌ Avoid:**

```
---
name: frontend-developer
description: Works on frontend development tasks
---
```

**Why:** Specific expertise leads to more targeted and effective assistance.

#### Actionable Descriptions

Write descriptions that clearly indicate when to use the agent.

**✅ Good:**

```
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and maintainability concerns
```

**❌ Avoid:**

```
description: A helpful code reviewer
```

**Why:** Clear descriptions help the main AI choose the right agent for each task.

### Configuration Best Practices

#### System Prompt Guidelines

**Be Specific About Expertise:**

```
You are a Python testing specialist with expertise in:

- pytest framework and fixtures
- Mock objects and dependency injection
- Test-driven development practices
- Performance testing with pytest-benchmark
```

**Include Step-by-Step Approaches:**

```
For each testing task:

1. Analyze the code structure and dependencies
2. Identify key functionality and edge cases
3. Create comprehensive test suites with clear naming
4. Include setup/teardown and proper assertions
5. Add comments explaining complex test scenarios
```

**Specify Output Standards:**

```
Always follow these standards:

- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Add docstrings for complex test functions
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
```

## Security Considerations

- **Tool Restrictions**: Subagents only have access to their configured tools
- **Sandboxing**: All tool execution follows the same security model as direct tool use
- **Audit Trail**: All Subagents actions are logged and visible in real-time
- **Access Control**: Project and user-level separation provides appropriate boundaries
- **Sensitive Information**: Avoid including secrets or credentials in agent configurations
- **Production Environments**: Consider separate agents for production vs development environments

## Limits

The following soft warnings apply to Subagent configurations (no hard limits are enforced):

- **Description Field**: A warning is shown for descriptions exceeding 1,000 characters
- **System Prompt**: A warning is shown for system prompts exceeding 10,000 characters
