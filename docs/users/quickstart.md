# Quickstart

> 👏 Welcome to OLA!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use OLA for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- A **terminal** or command prompt open
- A code project to work with
- A [OLA](https://chat.qwen.ai/auth?mode=register) account

## Step 1: Install OLA

To install OLA, use one of the following methods:

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**Linux / macOS**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://ola-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.sh | bash
```

**Windows (Run as Administrator CMD)**

```sh
curl -fsSL -o %TEMP%\install-qwen.bat https://ola-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.bat && %TEMP%\install-qwen.bat
```

> [!note]
>
> It's recommended to restart your terminal after installation to ensure environment variables take effect.

### Manual Installation

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Node.js 20 or later installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

**NPM**

```bash
npm install -g @ola/ola@latest
```

**Homebrew (macOS, Linux)**

```bash
brew install ola
```

## Step 2: Log in to your account

OLA requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `qwen` command, you'll be prompted to log in:

```bash
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
qwen
```

```bash
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
/auth
```

Select `Qwen OAuth`, log in to your account and follow the prompts to confirm. Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won't need to log in again.

> [!note]
>
> When you first authenticate OLA with your Qwen account, a workspace called ".qwen" is automatically created for you. This workspace provides centralized cost tracking and management for all OLA usage in your organization.

> [!tip]
>
> You can also configure authentication directly from the terminal without starting a session by running `qwen auth`. Use `qwen auth status` to check your current configuration at any time. See the [Authentication](./configuration/auth) page for details.

## Step 3: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start OLA:

```bash
# optiona
cd /path/to/your/project
# start qwen
qwen
```

You'll see the OLA welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands.

## Chat with OLA

### Ask your first question

OLA will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
explain the folder structure
```

You can also ask OLA about its own capabilities:

```
what can OLA do?
```

> [!note]
>
> OLA reads your files as needed - you don't have to manually add context. OLA also has access to its own documentation and can answer questions about its features and capabilities.

### Make your first code change

Now let's make OLA do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
add a hello world function to the main file
```

OLA will:

1. Find the appropriate file
2. Show you the proposed changes
3. Ask for your approval
4. Make the edit

> [!note]
>
> OLA always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable "Accept all" mode for a session.

### Use Git with OLA

OLA makes Git operations conversational:

```
what files have I changed?
```

```
commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
show me the last 5 commits
```

```
help me resolve merge conflicts
```

### Fix a bug or add a feature

OLA is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.

Describe what you want in natural language:

```
add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

OLA will:

- Locate the relevant code
- Understand the context
- Implement a solution
- Run tests if available

### Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with OLA:

**Refactor code**

```
refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
review my changes and suggest improvements
```

> **Remember**: OLA is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.

## Pro tips for beginners

**Be specific with your requests**

- Instead of: "fix the bug"
- Try: "fix the login bug where users see a blank screen after entering wrong credentials"

**Use step-by-step instructions**

- Break complex tasks into steps:

```
1. create a new database table for user profiles
2. create an API endpoint to get and update user profiles
3. build a webpage that allows users to see and edit their information
```

**Let OLA explore first**

- Before making changes, let OLA understand your code:

```
analyze the database schema
```

```
build a dashboard showing products that are most frequently returned by our UK customers
```

**Save time with shortcuts**

- Press `?` to see all available keyboard shortcuts
- Use Tab for command completion
- Press ↑ for command history
- Type `/` to see all slash commands
