## What Qwen Code does for you

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Qwen Code what you want to build in plain language. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Qwen Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Qwen Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](./features/mcp) can pull from external datasources like Google Drive, Figma, and Slack.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.

## Why developers love Qwen Code

- **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Qwen Code meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
- **Takes action**: Qwen Code can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](./features/mcp) lets Qwen Code read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use _your_ custom developer tooling.
- **Unix philosophy**: Qwen Code is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | qwen -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies appear in this log stream"` _works_. Your CI can run `qwen -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for @lang-fr-team to review"`.
