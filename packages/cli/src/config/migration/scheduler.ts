 * Chain scheduler for settings migrations.

 * It has no centralized version logic - migrations self-determine applicability.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Linear chain execution: migrations are applied in registration order
 * - Idempotent: already-migrated versions return false from shouldMigrate
 * - Adjacent versions only: each migration handles N → N+1
 * - Pure functions: migrations don't modify input objects
